        <p>These are great for making flatbreads, using for gyros or pitas. They can be cut in half and made into a pock ot cut into pieces and fried for pita chips. My favorite is reheating them on the grill and tearing them apart to dip in hummus.</p>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Add water, yeast, sugar, oil, and yogurt to the stand mixer and mix on low until combine.</li>
            <li>Add the flour and continue to mix on low until the dough comes together.</li>
            <li>Continue mixing on low for 3 minutes, then set speed to medium and mix for 8 - 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Place dough into a large lightly oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and allow it to bulk ferment for 2 hours or until doubled.</li>
            <li>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured work space and with your bench scraper portion the dough into 250g pieces.</li>
            <li>Pulling the corners of each portioned piece into the center, turning it smooth side up and rolling it gently into a ball, shape each portion.</li>
            <li>Lightly flour and cover your portioned dough balls and allow them to rest for 30 - 45 minutes.</li>
            <li>There are three ways to cook these flatbreads</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>On a clean, lightly oiled grill</li>
                    <li>In a cast iron or heavy bottom stainless steal pan on the stove. Lightly oiled and set to medium - medium-low head</li>    
                    <li>In the oven at 475&deg;F on a stone or similar heavy oven safe pan.</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Setup your prefered cooking method by preheating your oven, pan , or grill.</li>    
            <li>Roll out your portioned dough balls to roughly 8" and 1 cm thick.</li>
            <li>Place the flatbread into your pan or onto your grill.</li>
            <li>Once it begins to puff flip the flatbread and cook on the other side. If it blows up like a baloon that means it is done.</li>
            <li>Remove the flatbread and lay it on a cooling rack and continue cooking the rest of the flatbreads.</li>
            <li>Serve warm or allow to cool completely and store air tight for later.</li>
        </ol>
